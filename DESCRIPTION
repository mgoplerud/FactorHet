Description: This package faciliates the estimation of heterogeneous effects in factorial (and conjoint) models. Its details are fully described in Goplerud, Imai, and Pashley (2022) <doi:10.48550/ARXIV.2201.01357>. The methodology employs a Bayesian finite mixture of regularized logistic experts, where moderators can affect each observation's probability of cluster membership and a sparsity-inducing prior fuses together levels of each factor while respecting ANOVA-style sum-to-zero constraints.
