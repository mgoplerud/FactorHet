Description: Estimates heterogeneous effects in factorial (and conjoint) models. 
    The methodology employs a Bayesian finite mixture of regularized logistic
    regressions, where moderators can affect each observation's probability of 
    group membership and a sparsity-inducing prior fuses together levels of each 
    factor while respecting ANOVA-style sum-to-zero constraints. Goplerud, Imai, 
    and Pashley (2024) <doi:10.48550/ARXIV.2201.01357> provide further details.
